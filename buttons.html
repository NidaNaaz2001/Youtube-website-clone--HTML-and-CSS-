<!--Here we are learning to change the appearences of our buttons-->
<!--to change appearence we are writing a new attribute called style-->
<!--in style, button is a CSS selector which targets all the buttons in the page-->
<!--background-color = CSS property, red = CSS value-->
<!--Here, color means the text color-->
<!--px = pixels-->
<!--border-radius is used to give the rounded corners to the buttons-->
<!--Margin-right is used to give some space to the right of the button-->
<!--hovers,transitions and shadows are used to change the appearence of the button when mouse is placed on top of it-->
<!--hover adds extra style in special situations-->
<!--active is when the button is clicked the style changes to blue color background-->
<!--opacity tells the html how see through the button becomes 1 for max, 0 is min-->
<!--transition takes 2 property what we need to transit somety and for how many seconds-->
<!--box-shadow takes 4 attribute right, down, blur and color-->
<!--CSS box models allows us to keep the space inside the button as well as outside on the sides of consequetive buttons-->
<!--we can add space in top, button, left and right of the box model also within the button in all sides-->
<!--by this CSS box we can no longer be neede to give h and w of the button instead hust mention the space around the text in the button to be maintained-->
<!--This is also called padding-->
<!--verical align is to align all the buttons vertically on the top-->
